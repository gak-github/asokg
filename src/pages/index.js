          About Me (my leadership code)
        </h3>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;I am a very hard worker, and I like being consistent in whatever I do. In the past couple of years, I took up the habit of running in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle. I have been very consistent with this habit by running almost every day and taking part in races. I am also a strong believer in setting goals and following them faithfully. I also believe that in order to have a productive day, I need to wake up early and stay active. However, waking up before everyone else is not always easy so my motivation for waking up early is running or other sports activities. I enjoy being outdoors so anything that gets me out of the house is a huge motivator for waking up early. In my opinion, a good leader is empathetic and patient with others. I try to follow this to the best of my abilities because it is very important to put myself in other people's shoes. That is the only way you can truly understand their situation and conflict resolution will become easier. Overall, I am very consistent and motivated. I work hard and stay as active as possible.

          &emsp;&emsp;Communication skills and public speaking are the most important skills needed for a good leader. Unfortunately, I have always been lagging in this area, and I wish to overcome this. These skills are very important because they make it easier to connect with other people and they will make me stand out from my peers. In general, these skills will help me in life when it comes to communicating with others. Finally, I believe that a good leader inspires his/her peers, friends, and family. Different people are inspired by different things, but they usually include empathy, communication skills, and consistency. This goal also ties into my other goals such as communication skills. It is important for me to inspire other people if I want to bring changes to my family or even community
